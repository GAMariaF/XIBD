# XIBD: software for inferring pairwise identity by descent

http://bahlolab.github.io/XIBD/

## Features

* Estimates relatedness parameters for autosomes and the X chromosome
* Computes identity coefficients for autosomes and the X chromosome
* Detects genomic regions that are identical by descent (IBD) for autosomes and the X chromosome
* Allows the user to select one of two models to infer IBD
* Plots IBD segments for simple interpretation of results


## How to install XIBD

XIBD is currently available to install as a development version from Github:

```{r}
# install using devtools packages
devtools::install_github("bahlolab/XIBD")
```

**The R package reference data will be made available from the [XIBD web page](http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/XIBD/index.html) before August 2016.**


## How to use XIBD

See the introduction vignette for details.
